# ME-MqTT-Server-for-ESP8266

MqTT Server instance running into ESP8266 module

## Getting Started

The ME project aims to introduce into your IoT solutions the capabilty to have an MqTT server instance running into low cost module like ESP8266.
This would help to build solutions that leverages the Cloud Services having always a communication to that systems but that still work even there are network connectivity problems or Cloud outages.

Ok, in this case we could not enjoi of the cloud computing power, but the sensors and devices could communication and take actions between them leveraging by the local MqTT server instance.

Up to now, this scenario is built packaging for example a Raspberry with on board for example a Mosquitto instance. Ok, this is good, but this is not a low cost solution :-|


## Requirements

- ESP8266, I used the ESP12 wemos prototype board edition
- Arduino IDE with installed and configured ESP8266 boards
- ME MqTT server library
- ME MqTT server DATA to flash to SPIFFS
